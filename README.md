# SGC Chemistry Networks Project 001 - PFE-PKIS 5

This is the primary landing page for this [Structural Genomics Consortium](https://www.thesgc.org/) (SGC) Chemical Networks project. If you'd like to get involved, and agree to the RULES (link), you can.

The molecule at the heart of this project is this one:

<a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/mattodd/SGC_Sandbox/blob/master/PKIS5%20Starting%20Point.png?raw=true" align="centre" height="190" ></a>

The data on this compound, i.e. why it's an important target for synthetic variation, are on the wiki, here. 

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the FAQs (link to SGC Networks page). If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then the best thing to do is start an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (need) you can use to ask questions (include "PFE-PKIS 5" in the header).

The current scientific status of the project can be seen on the [wiki](https://github.com/mattodd/SGC_Sandbox/wiki) (you can always find the relevant tab above). The current version of the research paper describing this project is HERE (link) and is a great place to start if you're new to all this.

Some humans involved in this Network:
Professor David Drewry, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Original discoverer of the molecule  
Professor Matthew Todd, University College London and Head of Chemistry Networks at the SGC  
Dr X, Company X, Industry Mentor for the SGC CNP001
