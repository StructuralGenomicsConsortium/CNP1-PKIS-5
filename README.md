# SGC Chemistry Networks Project 001 - PFE-PKIS 5

This is the primary landing page for this Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) chemical synthesis project. If you'd like to get involved, and agree to the RULES, you can.
The molecule at the heart of this project is this one:

We're looking for people to make molecules like this one, share everything they're doing in real time, including samples of the molecules made. In return SGC scientists will carry out the biological evaluation of those molecules and collaborate with you towards papers and research funding.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the FAQs. If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then the best thing to do is start an Issue, which is a convenient way to communicate openly. The Issues will describe what needs doing. There's also an email address you can use to ask questions (include "PFE-PKIS 5" in the header).

The current scientific status of the project can be seen on the wiki (you can always find the relevant tab above). The current version of the paper is HERE and is a great place to start if you're new to all this.

Some humans involved:
Professor David Drewry, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. Original discoverer of the molecule  
Professor Matthew Todd, University College London and Head of Chemistry Networks at the SGC  
Dr X, Company X, Industry Mentor for the SGC CNP001
